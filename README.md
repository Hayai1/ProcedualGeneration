# ProcedualGeneration

this is a project for My non-exam-assessment testing how I would go about implimenting procedual generation for my side on game.
It uses a very similar approach to how the game "spelunky" did their procedual generation. 
I learned how it works with a very good website: https://tinysubversions.com/spelunkyGen/
